Project Proposal: Crop Yield Prediction

Introduction:
- Overview: The project aims to predict crop yields in India by leveraging machine learning
techniques on historical datasets.
- Significance: Yield prediction assists in estimating crop production, aiding in price regulation and
policy planning.

Objectives
- Develop a machine learning model to predict crop yields based on factors like location, season, and
crop type.
- Utilize previously collected datasets for training and testing the model.
- Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics like R-squared score and Mean Absolute
Error.

Data Preprocessing:
- Split dataset into training and test sets.
- Import necessary libraries for data manipulation and visualization.
- Handle missing values and encode categorical variables if necessary.

Model Development:
- Train a Simple Linear Regression model and evaluate its performance.
- Implement a Random Forest Regressor to capture non-linear relationships.
- Explore feature scaling techniques like StandardScaler to normalize data.

Model Evaluation:
- Calculate R-squared score to assess the goodness-of-fit of the model.

- Evaluate Mean Absolute Error, Mean Squared Error, and Root Mean Squared Error to gauge
prediction accuracy.

Implementation:
- Utilize Python libraries including numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn for data manipulation and
visualization.
- Train and test the models using the scikit-learn library.
- Employ RandomForestRegressor and DecisionTreeRegressor for yield prediction.

Results and Validation:
- Utilize cross-validation techniques to validate model performance.
- Compare the performance of different models to identify the most effective approach.
- Interpret the results and provide insights into factors influencing crop yields.
Conclusion:
- Summarize the project&#39;s objectives, methodology, and outcomes.
- Emphasize the importance of crop yield prediction for agricultural planning and policy-making in
India.
- Highlight potential future enhancements and applications of the developed model.
